# Kafka-read_csv
Ingesting data files in Apache Kafka is a very common task. Among all the various file formats that we can find, CSV is probably the most popular one to move data between different systems. This is due to its simplicity and to the fact that it can be used to export or import data from one (small) database to another.

A CSV file is nothing more than a text file (with a .csv extension). Each line of the file represents a data record and each record consists of one or more fields, separated by a comma (or another separator).
